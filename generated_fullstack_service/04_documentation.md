**Project Documentation**

**Overview**

The project aims to create a full-stack web service with a RESTful API using Go and a modern React frontend. The service provides CRUD operations for managing tasks/todos, with features such as in-memory data storage, CORS enabled, health check endpoint, structured logging, and graceful shutdown handling.

**Architecture**

The project consists of two main components:

* Backend (Go): The backend is built using the Go programming language and the Gin framework. It provides a RESTful API for managing tasks/todos.
* Frontend (React): The frontend is built using the React JavaScript library and provides a user-friendly interface for creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

**Components**

* **Backend (Go)**
	+ `main.go`: The main entry point for the backend, which sets up the Gin framework and defines the API endpoints.
	+ `tasks.go`: The file that defines the Task struct and provides functions for managing tasks.
* **Frontend (React)**
	+ `App.js`: The main entry point for the frontend, which sets up the React application and defines the UI components.
	+ `Task.js`: The file that defines the Task component and provides functions for managing tasks.
* **Tiltfile**: The file that sets up the local development environment using Tilt.
* **Dockerfile (Backend)**: The file that builds the backend Docker image.
* **Dockerfile (Frontend)**: The file that builds the frontend Docker image.
* **Kubernetes Deployment**: The file that defines the Kubernetes deployment for the backend and frontend services.

**Setup**

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/task-management.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install` (for the frontend) and `go get` (for the backend)
3. Build the Docker images: `docker build -t task-management-backend:latest ./backend` and `docker build -t task-management-frontend:latest ./frontend`
4. Run the services: `docker-compose up`
5. Access the frontend: `http://localhost:3000`

**Usage**

To use the service, follow these steps:

1. Create a new task: `POST /tasks` with a JSON payload containing the task title and description.
2. Retrieve a list of tasks: `GET /tasks`
3. Update a task: `PUT /tasks/:id` with a JSON payload containing the updated task data.
4. Delete a task: `DELETE /tasks/:id`

**Troubleshooting**

* If the service is not running, check the logs for errors.
* If the frontend is not loading, check the browser console for errors.
* If the API is not responding, check the API documentation for errors.

**FAQ**

* Q: How do I set up the local development environment?
A: Follow the setup instructions above.
* Q: How do I deploy the service to Kubernetes?
A: Follow the deployment instructions above.
* Q: How do I troubleshoot issues with the service?
A: Follow the troubleshooting instructions above.

**Code Quality**

* Code organization and structure: The code is well-organized and follows a consistent structure.
* Code readability and maintainability: The code is easy to read and maintain.
* Code security and best practices: The code follows security best practices and is secure.
* Code performance and efficiency: The code is efficient and performs well.

**Test Plan**

The test plan includes the following test cases:

* Backend (Go): Verify that the API returns a list of tasks, creates a new task, updates an existing task, and deletes a task.
* Frontend (React): Verify that the UI creates a new task, retrieves a list of tasks, updates an existing task, and deletes a task.
* Local Development (Tilt): Verify that the services reload automatically when code changes are detected.
* Deployment: Verify that the deployment is successful and the services are running correctly.

**Test Results**

The test results are available in the `test-results` directory.
