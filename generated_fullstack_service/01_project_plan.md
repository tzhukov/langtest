**Project Overview and Objectives**

The project aims to create a full-stack web service with a RESTful API using Go and a modern React frontend. The service will provide CRUD operations for managing tasks/todos, with features such as in-memory data storage, CORS enabled, health check endpoint, structured logging, and graceful shutdown handling. The frontend will be built using React, with a clean and responsive design, API integration with the Go backend, and error handling and loading states. The project will also include a Tiltfile configuration for local development, Docker Compose setup, and Kubernetes manifests for production deployment.

**Task Breakdown**

**Backend (Go)**

1. Set up Go project structure and dependencies
2. Implement REST API using Gin framework
3. Implement CRUD operations for managing tasks/todos
4. Implement in-memory data storage using slice/map
5. Enable CORS for React frontend
6. Implement health check endpoint at /health
7. Implement structured logging
8. Implement graceful shutdown handling
9. Create Dockerfile for containerization

**Frontend (React)**

1. Set up React project structure and dependencies
2. Implement task management UI with create, read, update, delete operations
3. Implement API integration with Go backend
4. Implement error handling and loading states
5. Implement TypeScript for type safety
6. Create Dockerfile for containerization

**Local Development (Tilt)**

1. Set up Tiltfile configuration for local development
2. Implement hot reloading for both backend and frontend
3. Set up Docker Compose for services
4. Implement automatic rebuilding on code changes
5. Configure port forwarding
6. Set up development environment variables

**Deployment**

1. Create Kubernetes manifests for production deployment
2. Optimize Docker images for production
3. Implement environment-specific configurations
4. Implement health checks and readiness probes

**Success Criteria**

* The service is fully functional and meets the requirements
* The service is production-ready and can be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster
* The service is easy to set up and develop locally using Tilt
* The service has a clean and responsive design
* The service has robust error handling and loading states

**Timeline Estimates**

* Backend (Go): 10 days
* Frontend (React): 10 days
* Local Development (Tilt): 2 days
* Deployment: 2 days
* Testing and Debugging: 5 days

**Risk Assessment**

* Risk: Inadequate testing and debugging may lead to production issues
* Mitigation: Conduct thorough testing and debugging throughout the project
* Risk: Incompatibility issues between Go and React may arise
* Mitigation: Use established libraries and frameworks to ensure compatibility
* Risk: Kubernetes deployment may be complex and time-consuming
* Mitigation: Use established best practices and seek guidance from Kubernetes experts

4. Week 7-8: Set up React project structure and dependencies, implement task management UI with create, read, update, delete operations, and implement API integration with Go backend
5. Week 9-10: Implement error handling and loading states, implement TypeScript for type safety, and create Dockerfile for containerization
6. Week 11-12: Set up Tiltfile configuration for local development, implement hot reloading for both backend and frontend, and set up Docker Compose for services
7. Week 13-14: Implement automatic rebuilding on code changes, configure port forwarding, and set up development environment variables
8. Week 15-16: Create Kubernetes manifests for production deployment, optimize Docker images for production, and implement environment-specific configurations
9. Week 17-18: Implement health checks and readiness probes, and conduct thorough testing and debugging
10. Week 19: Deploy the service to a Kubernetes cluster and monitor its performance
