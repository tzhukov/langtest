**Test Plan**

**Test Scope**

* The full-stack web service with a RESTful API using Go and a modern React frontend
* CRUD operations for managing tasks/todos
* In-memory data storage
* CORS enabled
* Health check endpoint
* Structured logging
* Graceful shutdown handling

**Test Cases**

**Backend (Go)**

1. GET /tasks: Verify that the API returns a list of tasks
2. POST /tasks: Verify that the API creates a new task
3. PUT /tasks/:id: Verify that the API updates an existing task
4. DELETE /tasks/:id: Verify that the API deletes a task
5. Health check endpoint: Verify that the API returns a successful response
6. Structured logging: Verify that the API logs messages with the correct format
7. Graceful shutdown handling: Verify that the API shuts down gracefully when requested

**Frontend (React)**

1. Task creation: Verify that the UI creates a new task successfully
2. Task retrieval: Verify that the UI retrieves a list of tasks successfully
3. Task update: Verify that the UI updates an existing task successfully
4. Task deletion: Verify that the UI deletes a task successfully
5. Error handling: Verify that the UI handles errors correctly
6. Loading states: Verify that the UI displays loading states correctly

**Local Development (Tilt)**

1. Hot reloading: Verify that the backend and frontend reload automatically when code changes are detected
2. Docker Compose setup: Verify that the services are set up correctly
3. Automatic rebuilding: Verify that the services rebuild automatically when code changes are detected
4. Port forwarding: Verify that the services are accessible through the correct ports

**Deployment**

1. Kubernetes deployment: Verify that the deployment is successful and the services are running correctly
2. Environment-specific configurations: Verify that the services are configured correctly for the production environment
3. Health checks and readiness probes: Verify that the services are healthy and ready for traffic

**Test Data**

* Sample tasks for testing CRUD operations
* Sample error messages for testing error handling
* Sample logging messages for testing structured logging

**Test Environment**

* Local development environment with Tilt
* Production environment with Kubernetes

**Test Schedule**

* Week 1-2: Test the backend API and frontend UI
* Week 3-4: Test local development with Tilt
* Week 5-6: Test deployment to Kubernetes
* Week 7-8: Test environment-specific configurations and health checks

**Test Deliverables**

* Test plan and test cases
* Test results and analysis
* Bug reports and recommendations
* Quality assessment of the implementation

**Code Quality Analysis**

* Code organization and structure
* Code readability and maintainability
* Code security and best practices
* Code performance and efficiency

**Code Quality Metrics**

* Code coverage
* Code complexity
* Code duplication
* Code security vulnerabilities

**Code Quality Recommendations**

* Improve code organization and structure
* Enhance code readability and maintainability
* Implement security best practices
* Optimize code performance and efficiency

Please note that this is a basic test plan and may require further development and testing to meet the specific requirements of your project.
